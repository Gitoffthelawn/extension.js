- Ideas for possible plugins:
  - validate-plugin: Ensure extension meets basic standards from stores
  - tos-generator-plugin: Adds required tos with sane defaults (with options)
  - package-plugin: zips plugin
  - publish-plugin: publish extesions via CLI
    - (can be interactive/have a UI bundled in-browser as an extension)
